            <p>The division into humanities and technical specialists is a deception. It's a division of power. The goal is to make people intellectually deficient when separated. Together, they make a good, strong person, but separately they are intellectually incomplete. They won't be very effective. That's the point - competitors aren't needed. Why create more smart people who are intelligent in every sense?</p>
<p>How has this always worked? Take Plato, for example. He wrote "The Republic." It's still relevant, still studied. He describes how an ideal state should be structured. What does he say? That a special layer of people is needed - guardians. Well, that's what he called them. Essentially, this is the elite. In short, there must be those who govern the state. They should be maximally intelligent, good, wonderful people. And then he explains how to create such people, how to prepare them.</p>
<p>He says: you need to select smart people, and then for 20 years, they should study Pythagorean sciences. What are these? Astronomy, algebra, geometry, stereometry. That is, mathematics. He said a person should study mathematics for 20 years. And only then philosophy. Because a philosopher isn't a mathematician, he's a philosopher. But to understand philosophy, you first need to train your brain with mathematics.</p>
<p>These things are inseparable. Mathematics develops the brain, and philosophy isn't for mediocre minds. A person who hasn't undergone intellectual preparation won't be able to grasp complex concepts. And what do we have now? Philosophers go to philosophy departments, thinking they're studying philosophy. But who are they studying? People who directly wrote: "First mathematics to become smart, then philosophy." But they don't do this. As a result, everything breaks down.</p>
<p>As a result, our technical specialists don't engage in humanities, becoming mere cogs in the system. Good executors, well done, bringing money to their master. And humanities scholars don't possess the powerful intellect needed to deeply feel philosophical concepts. Therefore, they can't use them effectively. They could understand how society works, how the system works, but it's not given to them. Instead - they gathered fools in the philosophy department, they sit there with merely librarian knowledge. A person remembered who said what, but didn't incorporate it into their consciousness because they're not capable.</p>
<p>What's the purpose of this system? When a person masters philosophy - they then govern well. Why did Plato devise this? Out of love for mathematics? No. He wasn't alone in this. The entire Greek civilization worked this way. The Renaissance later took example from it. These were ideals that worked.</p>
<p>Why was it like this? Let me explain. I'm such a person myself. I'm from math, studied mathematics with coding, gained significant intellectual enhancement through this. And then I became interested in philosophy and made a breakthrough in it. I can comprehend these things. I see how difficult they are. This isn't like reading a novel or school literature. It's like a textbook. You read, don't understand - read again. Still don't understand - read again. The concepts are heavy. A small brain won't lift them. You need to have great intellectual power.</p>
<p>And if you don't have it, a person can only memorize. "Plato said this, and Nietzsche said that." So what? Just a walking encyclopedia, not a philosopher. Because philosophy is a science of the elite. You know what the elite studies? The world elite, not ours, but the real one. Philosophy, political science, history, religion. And where's mathematics, where's physics? Please, study them. Then the masters control this, give it to people who are capable of comprehending.</p>
<p>And if you give philosophy to a humanities scholar who hasn't received intellectual stimulation, as Plato prescribed? It's safe. They won't understand anything. They graduate from philosophy departments - and what? What threat do they pose? None at all. They don't govern anyone. That's how it works.</p>
<p>Why is this? Let's examine it in detail. Philosophy consists of big, heavy stones. An ordinary person can't lift them. But they can train. Mathematics is like a gym. A person comes in, they're first given 2+2. These are like light dumbbells. Got used to it? Good. Then we introduce X. Oops, a new abstraction. Then XY. Then more difficult problems. Logarithms. Then geometry.</p>
<p>Mathematics is structured like a trainer that precisely selects weights. The complexity constantly increases. A person develops. Eventually, they reach complex numbers. Already monstrous abstractions. By the first year, they're prepared. And only then can they move on to philosophy.</p>
<p>Why not immediately? Because philosophical abstractions are big, they don't break down. You either understand or you don't. There are things you can't explain to stupid people. They simply won't understand. Any explanation is breaking down an idea into parts. But you can't explain philosophy that way.</p>
<p>As a result, a person learns to perceive mathematics in parts, becomes intellectually stronger, and then they can handle philosophical stones. Because philosophy has a high entry threshold. Not everyone can handle it. Try opening Plato in the original. It will be the most difficult thing in your life. Not everyone can handle it.</p>
<p>That's how it all works.</p>
