            <p>The elite studies philosophy, which means the common people study things like mathematics and other subjects that have nothing to do with reality. No matter how much you read, you don’t actually understand reality—you remain as ignorant as before. People have long accepted the fact that they don’t understand how society works at all—everyone considers it normal not to understand. They say that you need to study it, that it's unknown to everyone. But those who rule over you understand it perfectly because they have a proper education.  </p>
<p>You see, in these books, everything is written in plain text—how to govern, how social classes work, how to suppress people. It’s all there, clearly stated. And it’s crucial to ensure that the common folk never reach these kinds of knowledge. This is done very simply. First, their thinking is limited so that they never even look in that direction. And even if they do, so what? Books cost 5$, and buying something tasty at the supermarket also costs 5$. What choice does an average person usually make?  </p>
<p>I’ve already mentioned where the global elite goes to study. Their fields of study are philosophy, history, political science, and geology—never mathematics or economics. They rule over those who study economics. Let the commoners crunch their numbers; they won’t gain real knowledge from it. Everyone remembers the Slavic-Greek-Latin Academy, where the Russian elite studied. Why did they need Greek? Why did they need Old Church Slavonic? Why did they need Latin? The common people are told that the elite just had peculiar interests, just as they supposedly have 10 spoons instead of one. Learning languages was supposedly just one of their many eccentricities.  </p>
<p>But in reality, these languages were necessary to read ancient philosophers in the original. Latin was needed for reading Roman philosophers, Greek for Greek philosophers, and Church Slavonic for studying religious texts, which also contain important philosophical ideas.</p>
